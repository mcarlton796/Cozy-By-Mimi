                Commissions are open throughout the year and slots are open intermittently based on availability. A certain amount of slots are open each time, and openings are updated through my instagram @cozybymimi or by checking this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since commissions are personalized and vary in intricacy, their pricing can vary. Submitting the form only opens an inquiry and no payment is expected until agreed upon.
